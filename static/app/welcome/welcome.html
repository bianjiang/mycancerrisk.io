        <p>Welcome! Thank you for your interest in the “Developing a Facebook app to promote colorectal cancer screening: pilot testing a social media intervention” study.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this study is to help researchers understand what people know about colorectal cancer so that they can develop materials to prevent and detect the disease. 
        If you agree to be in this study, you would be asked to participate in a pre-study telephone interview, use a Facebook app, and a post-study telephone interview. Both telephone interviews should only take 15-20 minutes each. The Facebook app sends 1 Facebook message per month over 6 months. Participants will receive a $10.00 gift card for each telephone survey completed. There will be two surveys for a total of $20.00. There is no cost to you to participate in this research study.
        </p>

              <li>If you have not yet heard from us and you would like to participate, please call the Research Coordinator at 352-294-8417.</li>
              <li>If you have already completed the first telephone survey, please click the “login” button to create an account and verify your email address.</li>
              <li>Once your account is created you will be prompted to take a short online assessment to measure your estimated colorectal cancer risk. Once that is done you will not need to do anything until you get another notification from Facebook in 1 month prompting you to visit this site again for a follow up assessment. </li>
